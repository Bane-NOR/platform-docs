Welcome to the Bane NOR External Documentation portal! This centralized resource is designed to streamline your access to user guides, FAQs, best practices, and other relevant documentation essential for external users. This portal is your single source of truth for integrating with BaneNOR's platform services.

The content is curated for a technical audience, including developers, system architects, and technical specialists working on Bane NOR's three service platforms: **Development Platform**, **Integration Platform**, and **Data Platform**. By consolidating information previously scattered across multiple wikis, we aim to save time, eliminate confusion, and enhance productivity.

## How to Navigate  

To ensure ease of use, the documentation is organized into **three main sections**, each dedicated to one of Bane NOR's service platforms:

1. **Integration Platform**: Resources for connecting and integrating systems seamlessly.

Each section contains categorized articles, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides, making it easy to find the information relevant to your needs. Additionally, **a global search function indexes all content across platforms**, so you can locate any document or guide quickly without needing to know where it resides.
