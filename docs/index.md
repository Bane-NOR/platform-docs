Welcome to the Bane NOR External Documentation portal!

2. Platforms - This section has public documentation and information about the platforms under the Data & Analysis Platform, which consists of:
    - The Data & Analysis Platform

Each section contains categorized articles, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides, making it easy to find the information relevant to your needs.
3. Publications - This will consist of technical reports and technical findings we choose to publish
4. FAQ - Any frequetly asked questions.
Additionally, **a global search function indexes all content**, so you can locate any document or guide quickly without needing to know where it resides.
