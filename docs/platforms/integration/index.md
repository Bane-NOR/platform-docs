# Bane NOR Integration Platform

## What is The Integration Platform?

The Integration Platform is a set of reusable components for communication across Bane NOR domains. The Integration Team works towards self-service of the components made available for the developer teams.

## What do we deliver?

The integration platform is split into two main services:

- Event Driven Architecture (EDA)
- REST based synchronous messaging

For those outside of Bane NOR this comes in the form of [Even Issuer](/Event-Issuer) and [Payload Manager](/Payload-Manager)
