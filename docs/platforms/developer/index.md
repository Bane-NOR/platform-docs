# Bane NOR Developer Platform

## What is The Developer Platform?

The Developer Platform, with the team name Bullet, maintains and continuously improves a platform as a product to support product teams at Bane NOR. The platform's functions can span continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) toolchains and execution for multiple agile product teams delivering custom software, depending on the product teams' needs.

## What do we deliver?

The Developer Platform is delivered as a product for developers at Bane NOR to use. Collaboration between the platform team and product teams is critical to creating a software-defined platform that works to the standard required to protect the organization, while allowing product teams to move quickly.

For those outside of Bane NOR, the developer platform publicizes some of the resources used internally which can be foun on the [Bane NOR GitHub](https://github.com/bane-nor)
These consist of various resources like public base images, actions runner contoller and more.
